          <h2>Human Instrumentality</h2>
          <p>
            And now, the end is near And so I face the final curtain My friend,
            I'll say it clear I'll state my case, of which I'm certain I've
            lived a life that's full I traveled each and every highway And more,
            much more than this, I did it my way Regrets, I've had a few But
            then again, too few to mention I did what I had to do And saw it
            through without exemption I planned each charted course Each careful
            step along the byway And more, much more than this, I did it my way
            Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew When I bit off more than I
            could chew But through it all, when there was doubt I ate it up and
            spit it out I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way I've
            loved, I've laughed and cried I've had my fill, my share of losing
            And now, as tears subside I find it all so amusing To think I did
            all that And may I say, not in a shy way Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I
            did it my way For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself,
            then he has naught To say the things he truly feels And not the
            words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it
            my way Yes, it was my way
